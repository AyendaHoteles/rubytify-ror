# Disclaimer

I try to deploy on a VPS on Scaleway where I have some projects (I believe that uses Heroku is only for demos, I production you must tweak your system ), but I don't know yet what is wrong, I suspect that is something with nginx cause the domains point to the right IP and others projects (on RoR) works well :(, I know that a lice code is important but I tried a lot of solutions,and research a lot and don't find what is wrong, maybe I need more time :(.

Thanks for your time
